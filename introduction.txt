SapientiaLux - Illuminating Knowledge for Young Minds

Introduction

SapientiaLux : It is an offline AI-powered educational application designed specifically for school students in grades 1 through 12.
               It offers essential tools including grammar correction, essay evaluation, mathematical equation solving, general knowledge queries, and syllabus-based question answering.
               All functionalities are optimized to run smoothly on low-resource devices without requiring internet connectivity.
               The modular architecture supports scalability, while an update mechanism allows syncing new content whenever internet access becomes available.

Inspiration  : I was inspired to create SapientiaLux because the school in my village faced significant challenges:
               not all students had access to computers, and teachers often lacked the resources or skills to adequately address students' queries and doubts.
               Moreover, internet access is limited and often unrestricted, which can expose young students—especially during their formative years—to inappropriate content and distractions.
               To address these challenges, I envisioned an offline, desktop and Android-based Large Language Model (LLM) application.
               The goal is to provide students with a safe, self-contained learning environment that fulfills their educational needs without the risks or dependencies associated with internet access.
               This project aims to empower students and teachers alike, ensuring knowledge and curiosity can flourish under guidance and without oversight concerns.
